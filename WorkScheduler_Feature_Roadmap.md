Side notes:
When creating a calendar if admin does not put role it defaults to NONE
We don't leverage notes section in create shift
We also don't say the role in the shift modal
What to put in settings modal for calendar:
 - changing name of calendar
 - Promoting/demoting admin
 - giving privelages by role
 - changing your color
 - changing your role
 - admin allowing people to change their role (default on)
 - non admin's having the ability to change their role
 - allowing shift swaps without approval from admin (default no admin approval)
logging in with username or email
MOBILE CANT GET PAST LOGIN!!
When creating a schedule and clicking a start date in a different month, end date should update to that month not go back to current date
